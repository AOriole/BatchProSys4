# BPS - Batch Processing System
## About
Banks need to process credit & debit transactions,and apply them to account balances in a batch process.
These are to be triggered using GUI Interface. The account file is provided in JSON format & the transaction file is in flat file format with multiple record sets. The system then must display a graphical representation of overall credits & debits.

## Objective
To provide a GUI system which enables the user to select accounts file & batch file to process.

## Existing System
The existing system is a flat file format & JSON format system. Flat file multi-record systems are legacy, so are difficult to change. JSON format in contrast is much better supported & an industry standard.

## Scope & Areas of  Implementation
- The proposed solution could not only be implemented in banking but any system that requires loading, processing & visual representation of data.
- Ultimately, the system could be migrated to the web using Django & then consumed by not only by PCs but also by smart phones.
- With the implementation of a BRMS system the proposed solution would mirror many existing industry solutions.

## Deployment
The project is deployed locally.
